        This document is a user's guide and reference manual for Quine libraries.  Please read a little about history below
        to learn about the problem domain for which the libraries were written.  The individual libraries' pages provide even
        more history, background, use-cases and "war stories".  Use the navigation bar to the left to navigate between the different topics.

          dissolved mid 2024.  We automated manual workflows in movie and series productions, but the solution was a hard sell due
          to a combination of technical, market and - not the least - social factors.  I have been the main architect and
          developer at Quine and in this repository I have placed the most general-purpose code that I hope others will find a use for.
          I wrote this documentation as a hobby project to make it easier to study and possibly get started with using the code.
        </p><p>
          The company's name was borrowed from logician Willard Van Orman Quine. We also (briefly) considered to be brutally
          honest and name the company "Bug Factory" because all software has bugs somwehere.
        </p><blockquote>
          In these pages, I present fragments of the company's history from my POV, as the main architect, data-model designer and
          back-end developer; the other co-founders might present a different view.  Because I focus here on technical matters relevant
          for the released code, I strongly believe that the presented pieces are non-controversial.
        </blockquote><p>
          We started with "QuineBox", a customized Intel NUC attached to camera, that could upload edit proxies immediately
          after the recording was finished. It did this by capturing the camera's SDI stream and encoding it to prores or H.264
          in real-time.  (A side-note: QuineBox ran on embedded Windows edition.)  This could have been a great improvement over the "usual" workflows, where recordings are offloaded to "orange
          disks" and sent to editors by train, taxi or such.
          (We invented "camera to cloud" before it became an established term!) Unfortunately, QuineBox had some critical
          problems -- mostly around network connectivity and manufacturing costs -- which forced us to abandon it and focus on a production
          asset management system (PAM).
        </p><blockquote>
          Q: Users of QuineBox wondered why uploads to FTP servers on public internet "just worked", but were troublesome towards
          FTP servers on the local network.  A: Because internet is maintained by people who have a clue about networking.
          (Hard truth that we never told to our users.)
        </blockquote><p>
          Our PAM system was to be the 3rd step in the evolution of media productions:
        </p><ol><li><p>
              Analog recording devices (film reels, audio tapes), manual workflows.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Digital recording devices, manual workflows (assets tracked in Excel, often printed sheets).
            </p></li><li><p>
              Digital recording devices, digital and automated workflows (assets tracked in a searchable database).
            </p></li></ol><p>
          After switching our focus to PAM, we developed QuineIngest (QI), an application which automated a number of tasks: secure copying,
          transcoding, uploading to cloud for sharing, automation triggered by watch folders, etc.  The libraries in this repository have been
          pulled out from QuineIngest and prepared for stand-alone use.
        </p><p>
          QI was also accompanied by a web application that allowed users to browse and play clips, while editors could make a selection and
          export a ready-to-edit project for Adobe Premiere or AVID.  Shortly before we shut down, the web application also got a feature for
          automatic transcription (speech-to-text) of recorded material.  I did not have much involvement in these segments.
        </p><p>
          Other areas which I <em>have</em> been involved with are programmatic Azure deployments, authentication and security (based
          on AzureAD (now EntraId) groups), program licensing and activation.  These parts are currently of the scope of the released
          libraries because they were tailored to QI and thus not very generic.
